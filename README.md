## Todo List

I have read recently that [every time you build a to-do list app, a puppy 🐕 dies 😢](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d) . Even though I agree that the idea is definitely not cutting-edge, I have learned a lot by doing this project about the DOM, events, Local Storage, CSS gradients, how to create user interaction and how to use basic Sass features. The project was designed according to mobile first approach.
